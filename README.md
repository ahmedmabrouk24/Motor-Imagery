# Motor Imagery Using EEG Signal

## Overview

This repository contains a motor imagery application that predicts movement direction based on EEG signals. The application utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze EEG data and make predictions about the intended movement direction.

## Introduction
Welcome to the Motor Imager using EEG Signal repository! This application aims to predict movement direction based on EEG signals, providing a valuable tool for Brain-Computer Interface systems which enables individuals to control external devices or computers using their brain signals, including those generated during motor imagery tasks.

## Features

- Predicts movement direction from EEG signals.
- Machine learning model for motor imagery analysis.
- Easy-to-use interface.


## Interface
The application offers a basic interface with a single button to predict the movement of the next sample in the test dataset. The predicted movement is visually represented by a colored arrow. To get started, follow these steps:
